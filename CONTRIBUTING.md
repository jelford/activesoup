## What to expect from me

`activesoup` is a hobby project, without a surrounding community. 
It's something I knocked up in my spare time to help me automate interacting with a website.
That means that any code triage, review, or answers have to be provided by me - in 
my spare time (I don't use this at work). 

Because `activesoup` doesn't have too many users, the workload associated with that is
_low_ and I don't mind doing it (I'm happy to!) - but the flip side is that I'll get to your request
when I have time (probably: at the weekend, if I need to look at code).  

I won't assume you've meticulously read all the code, or got a great
understanding from the (practically non-existent) documentation. 
Feel free to jump in and ask your question / submit your PR - I'm just happy
you're finding this thing useful, and grateful if you want to improve it.

## When will you see your changes?

`activesoup` gets released whenever I add a version tag (which is manually). I'll generally
try to do that straight after merging any changes.

## What I expect from you

`activesoup` is a hobby project. When I look at a PR, I'll assume you
will have tested your changes, and - where you've changed behaviour -
added or updated the unit tests. Travis will run the tests before 
I merge, but test coverage isn't terribly complete, and to some extent
I'm relying on you to make sure things don't break.
